## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

To run the simulations and scripts in this project, you will need the following software installed.

### 1. Software Prerequisites

* **MATLAB & Simulink (Version R2023a or newer is recommended)**
* **Git** for version control

### 2. Required MATLAB Toolboxes

This project relies on specific toolboxes for modeling power electronics. Please ensure you have the following installed:

* **Simulink¬Æ** (Core environment)
* **Simscape Electrical‚Ñ¢** (Essential for PV array, converters, and other physical electrical components)

### 3. Setup Instructions

1.  **Install MATLAB, Simulink & Toolboxes:**
    * As a student, you most likely have free access to a full MATLAB license through your university.
    * Go to the [MathWorks student portal](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/students.html) and sign in or create an account using your **university email address**.
    * Download the installer and run it.
    * When you reach the product selection screen (the checklist of toolboxes), make sure you select **at least** the following:
        * `MATLAB`
        * `Simulink`
        * `Simscape Electrical` (You may find this under the `Simscape` product family)

2.  **Install Git:**
    * Download and install the latest version of Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.
    * Clone this repository using the following command:
        ```bash
