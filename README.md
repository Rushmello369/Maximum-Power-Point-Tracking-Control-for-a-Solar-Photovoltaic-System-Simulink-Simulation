# Maximum-Power-Point-Tracking-Control-for-a-Solar-Photovoltaic-System-Simulink-Simulation-
This project develops and simulates a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control algorithm for a solar photovoltaic system using MATLAB/Simulink.
Objectives

This project aims to design and implement an MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithm to optimize the power output of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system under varying environmental conditions. A DC-DC boost converter is modeled to interface the PV array with a load, and real-time MPPT ensures maximum efficiency.

🧠 Motivation

As the world transitions to renewable energy, power electronics plays a critical role in energy conversion and grid integration. MPPT controllers are essential in solar power systems, ensuring maximum utilization of solar irradiance.

This project strengthens key engineering abilities valued by power system companies like National Grid, UK Power Networks, Siemens Energy, GE Vernova, and ABB:

✅ Power electronics simulation
✅ Renewable energy system analysis
✅ Control algorithms implementation
✅ Practical grid engineering relevance
